# Pentesting Fundamentals
### Ethicality
Penetration tests are **authorized audits or contracts** between a cybersecurity team and the owners of the computer systems. Anything that is out of bounds of the agreed upon the contract can be unauthorized or even illegal and punishable by law. The scopes and bounds of the contract must be negotiated first.

There are different kinds of hackers and their ethics and motivations can differ.
- **White Hat:** Considered "good" and they stay within the bounds of the law, using their skills to benefit others. Ex: corporate cybersecurity teams.
- **Grey Hat:** They can use their skills to benefit people, but they don't always follow the law. Ex: Taking down a scamming website, or whistleblowing.
- **Black Hat:** These people are criminals, usually motivated by financial gain. Ex: Malware authors who code ransomware.

#### Rules of Engagement (ROE)
A ROE is a document created during the initial set up stages of creating an agreed upon penetration test. [Here is an example of a ROE document.](https://sansorg.egnyte.com/dl/bF4I3yCcnt/?)

1. **Permission:** Section of the ROE where explicit permission is set in writing. Meant to legally protect the individual or organizations for carrying out the pentest.
2. **Test Scope:** Section where specific targets and bounds are set. Ex: The pentest can only focus on certain servers, instead of the entire network.
3. **Rules:** Defines what techniques are permitted during the pentest. Ex: Phishing attacks are not allowed, but buffer overflows are allowed.

### Methodologies
- **Information Gathering:** Involves collecting as much publicly available information as possible. Involves research and open source intelligence (OSINT).
- **Enumeration / Scanning:** Involves discovering applications and services running on a system. Ex: Finding a vulnerable web server.
- **Exploitation:** Leverages the vulnerabilities on a system or service. Can either use publicly available or well known exploits, or may also involve exploiting the logic on a service / system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Once you have exploited a system or service, this is where you attempt to expand the amount of access you have.
	- Horizontal escalation means you are accessing other accounts within the same permission group. Ex: Accessing another student's account.
	- Vertical escalation means you are jumping permission groups entirely. Ex: Jumping from a basic user or student account to an admin account.
- **Post-exploitation**: Involves a few substages;
	1. What other hosts can be targeted (called **pivoting**)
	2. What additional info can be gathered from the host now that we are a privileged / root user
	3. Covering the tracks you made
	4. Reporting

### Differing Frameworks
#### OSSTMM Standards and Frameworks
The methodologies focus on the following systems, applications and protocols:
1. Telecommunications (phones, voice over Internet Protocol [VoIP])
2. Wired networks
3. Wireless communications
