[Website that is going to be tested.](https://lab_web_url.p.thmlabs.com/) (Use the site's VPN and virtual machine in order to activate this site.)

### Viewing the page source.
Page sources are a mix of HTML and CSS code. which makes up the website's design layout and as well as the more internal components.

Most browsers support viewing the page source, with **view-source:https://www.google.com/**

You can also do this hrough your browser's GUI, by finding it as a dedicated buttom or in developer tools and modes.

Code that starts with ```<!--``` and ending with ```-->``` are comments left by a dev. It can sometimes give you insights to how a certain element on the page works.

Different parts of the part are written in HTML anchor tags, which are elements that start with ```<a```.
