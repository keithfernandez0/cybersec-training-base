# Manual Website Walkthrough
Some skills that will be learned in this unit:
- **Viewing the source:** Using the browser to see human-readable source code of a website.
- **Inspect element:** Viewing page elements and making changes to view blocked content.
- **Debugging:** Inspecting and controlling the flow of the page's JavaScript.
- **Network view:** Seeing the packet/network requests a page makes.

[Website that is going to be tested.](https://lab_web_url.p.thmlabs.com/) (Use the site's VPN and virtual machine in order to activate this site.)

### Viewing the page source.
Page sources are a mix of HTML and CSS code. which makes up the website's design layout and as well as the more internal components.

Most browsers support viewing the page source, with **view-source:https://www.google.com/**

You can also do this through your browser's GUI, by finding it as a dedicated button or in developer tools and modes.

Code that starts with ```<!--``` and ending with ```-->``` are comments left by a developer. It can sometimes give you insights to how a certain element on the page works.

Different parts of the part are written in HTML anchor tags, which are elements that start with ```<a```.

### Using developer tools - Inspector
Three basic tools in a developer toolkit:

- Inspect Element
- Debugger
- Network View

**Inspector:** Gives a live presentation of what elements are active on a page. We can also edit the elements of the page for a different output.
