# Principals of Security
### The CIA Triad
The CIA Triad is an information security model developed in 1998. The security of information does not only start and end with cybersecurity, but applies to all aspects of archiving and retrieving data and information.

#### Confidentiality
Confidentiality is to protect data from parties that it is not intended for. Data protection for preventing unauthorized access and misuse. This can include sensitive employee records only accesible to HR


#### Integrity
Information and data has to be kept accurate and consistent as possible, to avoid careless mistakes and changing of data. Access control and rigorous authentication help insure that files and data aren't corrupted or done sloppily.

#### Availability
For data to be useful to you, it has to be retrievable.

In the case of an organization or government agency, having 99% uptime is vital to making sure that system data retrieval is up to par. This can include:

- Having reliable hardware for their servers
- Having redundancies in technology and services
- Having tight security protocols to protect technology from attacks

### Principles of Privileges
Levels of access are given to people in an agency / company for two main factors:

- **Privilege Identity Management (PIM):** The person's role in the organization
- **Privilege Access Management (PAM):** The sensitivity of the information in question

PIM is for translating access roles to a user. 
PAM is the management of said user privileges.

There is a principle of least privilege, meaning that a user should be given the least amount of privileges possible while still allowing the minimum amount of permissions so they can complete their tasks.

PAM involves more of the assignment of said privileges, and also involved the enforcement of security policy to reduce the attack surface of a system.

### Security Models (Continued)
#### Bell-La Paluda Model
Model works in a top-down style, users on top of the hierarchy can view down, but users on the bottom can look up the hierarchy. Requires a lot of established trust in a system. *(This model assumes you have an established hierarchy and have good user roles with a vetting process.)*

#### Biba Model
Focuses on situations where data integrity is more prioritized than confidentiality.. People can read up, but not down. Inverse of the Bell-La Paluda Model. Can cause some delays in data availability.

### Threat Modelling & Incident Response
Threat modelling is the review, improvement, and testing of security protocol. You need to identify likely threats that are applicable and realistic to what you are doing. The core principles of what a good threat model can do are:

- Prepare
- Identify
- Damage control
- Review

An *effective* threat model includes:
- Threat intelligence
- Asset identification
- Mitigation capabilities
- Risk assessment

There are two frameworks to use:

**S.T.R.I.D.E**
1. **Spoofing:** Authenticating requests and users that are accessing a system. *(Ex: Use of API or access tokens.)*
2. **Tampering:** Providing integrity to data. *(Ex: Certificates for a protocol, sending secure packets to encrypted endpoints.)*
3. **Repudiation:** Logging and tracking services and applications used. *(Ex: Using HR or management software to scope for inappropriate uses of employee computers and machines.)*
4. **Information disclosure:** Applications and services must be configured to show information that is relevant to the user. *(Ex: A user with basic permissions will not be shown admin or root level output.)*
5. **Denial of service:** Measures in place to prevent abuse of an application or service. *(Ex: Anti-spam software, packet timeouts, etc.)*
6. **Elevation of privilege:** User was able to escalate their roles to a higher level, and can lead to further exploitation or information disclosure. (Ex: An unauthorized user gaining admin or root level access.)
