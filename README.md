# Cybersecurity & Pentesting Notes Base
### Obsidian Vault and environment files for studying cybersecurity concepts.
Some learning tools that will be used:
- TryHackMe
- TutorialsPoint / LinuxConfig.org (specifically for C)
- OverTheWire
- PicoCTF
- Certification training materials

This repository also has some of my personal plugin files and preferences in their respective JSON and Javascript files. Feel free to remove or add on to them.
Also this repo is best used with the Obsidian markdown editor as it allows you to link your notes to each other, and create a mindmap of related concepts. The wikilinks feature is great, but these notes should still be useful even if you don't use the editor.
